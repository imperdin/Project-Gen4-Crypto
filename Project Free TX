The goal is to enable a secure way to provide 0 fee tx to users while also doing so securely


How to achieve doing so:

The goal is to enable users to send a 0 fee tx directly to pools (Note, Nodes will reject any 0 fee tx unless it's already mined)

As pools can just push new tx into blocks and 0 fee tx are valid they could just add the 0 fee tx to the block templete

So why should pools do such a thing?

Pools can request the users trying to send the free tx to submit some hashes to support the pools so the pool is incentived to do so
And the pool can also increase the amount of hashes required to do so dynamically based on the back-log


So spammers cannot abuse it as the amount of shares required for spamming increases with the back-log so they will not be able to filled the queues
And they also lose money by not submitting the hashes themselves


So all in all it's a secure method to enable 0 fee tx by giving the pools an incentive to do so
